# N4-Framework
 
 N4 Front-End Developpement Framework is a personnal developpement tool made to build simple websites. 
 
 It uses features suchs as:
 
 * Components (standalone module needs to be released when ready)
 * InstantNav (standalone module needs to be released when ready)
 * ScrollFX (https://github.com/Nepmia/Jquery-navScrollFX)
 
 But no more actually, I will add some stuff time-by-time.
 
 ## Components
 
 The component system is inspired from Angular, allowing the creation of components to be deployed easely, for example a buton that can be deployed with custom text, links and attributes just within a line in an html file.
 
 It is not as powerful as Angular's one obviously, it's made to be simple and usable for small projects instead of production one because it renders and build the page directly when the client connect on it, it can be used for production but very very very discouraged, because it's easely breakable and uses the client's performances to build the page.
 

## InstantNav

A simple, but extremely useful system. It allow to bypass and remove the reload between your page, using a template system.

Basically having an index, without content, only your head, styles and scripts. InstantNav animate a page switch, making it very intuitive and dynamic, it uses a normal url system and works with history butons.

## ScrollFX 

A very simple module that will retract and expand navbar depending on user scroll, it has multiples functions such as navlock.



N4 Framework is still in developpement features will be added with time, but for now it's just a basic framework.
